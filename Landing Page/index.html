            <p><q>
            The third of the medieval city-states in the Kathmandu Valley,
             Bhaktapur was always described as the best preserved. 
             Tragically, however, the 2015 earthquake caused terrible devastation and loss of life. 
             Nevertheless, only a few temples were destroyed, there is still much to see here and tourism is vital to the community.

                  With five storeys towering 30m above the square, this is the tallest temple in all of Nepal and one of the tallest buildings in the Kathmandu Valley. 
                  This perfectly proportioned temple was built in 1702 during the reign of King Bhupatindra Malla, 
                  and the construction was so sturdy that the 1934 and 2015 earthquakes caused only minor damage. "</p>

         </p><p>
          People welcome Basanta, or spring, through this Jatra, which is held in mid-April. Biska Jatra is the largest jatra celebrated in Bhaktapur. It is celebrated for eight nights and nine days, thus, is also known as the Chyacha Gunhuya Jatra, which translates to “eight-night and nine-day jatra.”
        </p><p>
          This jatra is also known as Bisket Jatra and Vishwodhoj jatra.

        <p>Indra Jatra is a revered festival with processions of living gods and goddesses, the dance of the demon, Lakhe, and several other masked performers who converge on the main Durbar Square.

        <p>Yomari Punhi is an auspicious day for the Newari community. On this day Kathmandu Valley residents worship Annapurna, the goddess of crops and food, and pray for a good rice harvest.</p>
        <p>Yomari is unquestionably one of the most popular Newari food items. It is a steamed fish-shaped dumpling covered in new-harvest rice flour and filled with chaku (molasses) or khuwa (condensed milk) and sesame seeds. Yomari is wholesome, delicious and nutritious dessert for snacks.</p>
